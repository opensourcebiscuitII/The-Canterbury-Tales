# this is a small choose-your-own adventure videogame based on the Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. 
# I chose three of the Tales to adapt: The Pardoner's Tale, The Friar's Tale, and The Franklin's Tale. 
# I did my best to incorporate real historical details about Chaucer's life and times.

#IMPORTANT: please make sure you are using the correct inputs when testing in the terminal
